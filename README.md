# responsive-view-height-test

This is a testing repository for my tetris app. I just want to see how using responsiveness based on the view height would work, compared to the view width.
I am doing this because I have been creating the tetris web application on my desktop computer. Recently I tested it on my laptop, only to find it didn't work scale correctly.
Hopefully scaling based on the view height of a device will make it scale more naturally to fit on any size device - it should also reduce the inconsistencies in the sizing.
